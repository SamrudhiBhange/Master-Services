                Master Services assigns a dedicated enterprise architect who initially conducts the assessment of the current enterprise service and infrastructure environment and is responsible for developing the target solution and associated cost to transition. Master Services enterprise architects possess the deep operational delivery experience and technical knowledge required to understand and develop the most optimal solution to meet enterprise requirements. They are augmented by subject matter experts from Master Services delivery organizations, to provide solution analysis, timeline and cost validation for the applicable areas within scope. The team evaluates the enterprise’s resources, platforms and processes across all domains of the data center (including facilities, hardware, virtual and operating systems, middle-ware, database, applications and end users) to gain a comprehensive understanding of capabilities to be able to advise where outsourcing will provide the greatest benefit. The output of the assessment is a detailed proposal inclusive of a solution design, statement of work, project plan and business case, which is formally presented in person to the enterprise.

                Once the target environment is in place, Master Services ongoing managed services take over. Services include field engineering; service/help desk; monitoring; systems administration and technical support services, all of which are further evolved through continuous improvement initiatives. Master Services remote infrastructure management service (RIMS), delivers IT services from regional and global operations centers worldwide. Each center is modeled with network and security operations monitoring capabilities, and technical and product domain expertise in support of the core services provided above. Master Services also compliments its remote capabilities with field engineering teams that are co-resident at client’s end user and/or datacenter locations who work closely and under the guidance of the technical experts when services require on-site support. Master Services also incorporates a global logistics organization for ongoing equipment support in datacenters and end user locations, and a procurement organization tied to a global partner program enabling technology refreshes as part of modernization and continuous improvement initiatives, both which are core components to any multi-year program. Similar to our integration services, these teams leverage established processes and tools which make them best in class and allow for rapid global scale at competitive prices. At the same time, Master Services recognizes that clients have invested in environments which they wish to maintain. In addition or in place of its own platforms, Master Services works with a range of manufacturer’s products owned by its clients and for any new technology which needs to be adopted and has a tried and true process to acquire the necessary experience to do so.
